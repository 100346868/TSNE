# Alfonso Albacete Zapata t-SNE
This is an implementation of the algorithm t-Stochastic Neighbour Embeeding for the Bachelor Thesis.

# What can you find?
In this repository I have uploaded all the contents you need to test the algorithm by yourself. I have made a pedagogic implementation that cn be compared. There are two versions of my implementation, one of them plot the converging of the algorithm for several iterations. The other version just calculates the final stage and it exports the initialization of the low dimensional space so we can use the same with the Rtsne package. There are several databases I have obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php . 

If you have any doubt about the code or the algorithm, do not hesitate to contact me: 100346868@alumnos.uc3m.es
